### Services
- **ApiService**: Service for API communication with the web backend

## What Needs to Be Done

### Platform-Specific Setup
1. **iOS Configuration**:
   - Set up Info.plist for URL schemes and permissions
   - Configure entitlements for secure storage

2. **Android Configuration**:
   - Update AndroidManifest.xml for required permissions
   - Set up network security configuration

### Testing
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test API service methods
   - Test model conversions (JSON parsing)
   - Test business logic in AppState

2. **Widget Tests**:
   - Test screen rendering
   - Test interactive components
   - Test error states

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end flows for main user journeys

### Advanced Features
1. **Offline Support**:
   - Cache API responses for offline viewing
   - Queue actions when offline

2. **Push Notifications**:
   - Team status changes
   - Event reminders
   - Championship updates

3. **Deep Linking**:
   - Enable deep links to specific teams/events
   - Share links to team storyboards

### Performance Optimization
1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for team/event images
   - Lazy loading for list views

2. **State Management Refinement**:
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Consider using more granular providers

### Deployment
1. **App Store / Play Store Setup**:
   - Generate app icons and splash screens
   - Create store listings
   - Prepare screenshots

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up automated builds
   - Configure testing in CI

## How to Complete the Implementation

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Flutter SDK
   - Set up Android Studio/Xcode
   - Configure emulators/simulators

2. **Running the App**:
   - `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
   - `flutter run` to launch in debug mode

3. **API Integration**:
   - The app expects a Blue Alliance API key
   - The API service is configured to work with the web app backend
   - Update baseUrl in ApiService if the backend URL changes

4. **Platform-Specific Development**:
   - Follow the Flutter documentation for platform integration
   - Test on both iOS and Android

## Design Considerations

1. **Theming**:
   - The app supports both light and dark modes
   - Uses a consistent color scheme based on indigo blue

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Consider adding screen reader support
   - Ensure sufficient contrast and touch targets

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The app shows user-friendly error messages
   - Implements retry mechanisms for network failures

## Known Limitations

1. **API Usage**:
   - The Blue Alliance API has rate limits
   - Some data may be delayed based on API refresh rates

2. **Authentication**:
   - Currently uses API key only
   - Could be extended to support user accounts

3. **Team/Event Coverage**:
   - Limited to what The Blue Alliance API provides
   - Some international events may have less complete data
